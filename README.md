# Publication-A-parallel-rank-adaptive-integrator-for-dynamical-low-rank-approximation
This repository can be used to reproduce all numerical experiments of the paper "A parallel rank-adaptive integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation" by Ceruti, Kusch and Lubich. 

To run the code, download and install the Julia programming environment (https://julialang.org/downloads/) and navigate into one of the subfolders. Open the Julia REPL (by typing julia into the command line). Press the `]` key to open the package manager and type `activate .` and `instantiate` to download and install all required packages. After that, hit backspace to quit the package manager and type `include("main.jl")` to run all numerical experiments provided in the subfolder.
